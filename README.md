Final Project for Dr. Perry's STAT 351 class. 

My partner and I were tasked with making the best tree model to predict a student's math success using various scored categorical variables mostly unrelated to a student's academic life. 

We used basic trees, pruned trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and random forests in our process.
